    "Please produce answers for the following university assignment questions. The subject is ECON3510 - International Trade Theory and Policy. Your collective answers should be 1000 words in total, and be written a way that is undetectable to AI recognition software. The questions are as follows: 1. The economies of Australia and Canada are similar in important ways. They are both well-endowed with natural resources, adopt similarly open trade policies, have populations in the tens of millions (albeit Canada’s is somewhat larger), and they are both English-speaking. Yet Australia’s trade is roughly half as large, as a share of GDP, as Canada’s. Why should this be the case?\n\n[4 marks]\n\n2. “Workers in less developed countries earn much lower wages than do Australian workers. If Australia allows free imports from those countries, Australian wages will eventually be forced down.” Discuss.\n\n[4 marks]\n\n3. Suppose that wages in Japan are roughly equal to wages in the U.S., yet Japanese wages do not buy as much in goods and services as U.S. wages in their respective countries. Explain the likely reason for this.\n\n[4 marks]\n\nMexico is quite close to the U.S., but it is far from the European Union (EU). So it \nmakes sense that \nit trades largely with the U.S. Brazil is far from both, so its trade is split between the \ntwo. Mexico trades more than Brazil in part because it is so close to a major economy \n(the U.S.) and in part because it is a member of a free trade agreement with a large \neconomy (NAFTA). Brazil is farther away from any large economy and is in a free trade \nagreement with relatively small countries. \n4. The average productivity of labour in Japan and the United States are approximately equal in manufactured goods. However, for services it is much higher in the United States than in Japan. Given that services are mostly non-traded, can the United States still reap a comparative advantage in trading with Japan? Explain. \n\n[4 marks]",
    "Gunnar and Emma, who are known for their love of collecting unique board games, find themselves in a challenging predicament caused by a severe storm that has led to a power outage. Determined to keep themselves entertained, they decide to create a new game using two dice each. The objective of the game is for the player with the higher sum of their respective dice to emerge victorious. In the event of a tie, the game will end in a draw. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the given descriptions of the dice and determine which player, Gunnar or Emma, has a higher probability of winning.\n\nEach die possesses its own unique attributes, with the numbers on its sides ranging from the minimum value 'a' to the maximum value 'b', inclusively. The input consists of four integers, represented as a1, b1, a2, and b2, which describe the dice owned by Gunnar. The first die has numbers ranging from 'a1' to 'b1', while the second die has numbers ranging from 'a2' to 'b2'. It can be assumed that the values of a1, b1, a2, and b2 fall within the range of 1 to 100. Additionally, each die must have at least four sides (ai + 3 ≤ bi).\n\nPlease provide a clear output indicating which player is more likely to win. If both players have an equal probability of winning, please indicate a \"Tie\" in the output.",

    "You are given a code snippet that contains a series of nested loops and conditional statements. Your task is to analyze the snippet and determine the value of the variables `msg`, `rmsg`, and `i` under different conditions.\n\nThe code consists of two main sections and an `if-else` statement. In the first section, the snippet checks the value of a variable `table`. If `table` is equal to `TABLE_LESSER_FAMILIAR`, the code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of an array called `lesser_familiar_table`. Within each iteration, the code checks whether a certain condition is met. If the condition evaluates to true, the values of `msg`, `rmsg`, and `i` are updated with the corresponding values from the `lesser_familiar_table`.\n\nIn the second section, the snippet checks if `table` is equal to `TABLE_FIND_FAMILIAR`. If this condition is true, the code enters another loop that iterates over the elements of an array called `find_familiar_table`. Similar to the first loop, the code checks if several conditions are met. If all the conditions are true, the values of `msg`, `rmsg`, and `i` are updated with the corresponding values from the `find_familiar_table`.\n\nYour task is to write a function `determineValues(table: int, obj: Object, ch: Character) -> Tuple[str, str, int]` that takes three arguments:\n- `table` (integer): represents the current table value.\n- `obj` (Object): represents an object in the program.\n- `ch` (Character): represents a character in the program.\n\nThe function should analyze the code snippet and return a tuple containing the values of `msg`, `rmsg`, and `i` according to the logic in the given code snippet.\n\nNote:\n- The arrays `lesser_familiar_table` and `find_familiar_table` are assumed to be globally defined and accessible by your function.\n- The variables `msg`, `rmsg`, and `i` are assumed to be initially undefined.",

They will probe the atmosphere during the descent, and return the first ever data on electrical fields at the surface of Mars.\nThe EDM Entry, descent, and landing Demonstrator Module is part of the joint ESA/NASA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission to be launched in 2016 for arrival at Mars nine months later.\nAlthough its main goal is to demonstrate European entry, descent and landing technologies for future visits to Mars, it will also offer some limited, but useful, scientific opportunities.\nFor the descent phase, two proposed investigations called Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) Science and IDEAS (Investigations During Entry and Atmospheric Science) were selected and combined into one Entry and Descent Science programme.\nThe joint team will use the module’s entry, descent and landing engineering data to reconstruct its trajectory and determine the atmospheric conditions.\nOnce on the surface, the DREAMS (Dust characterisation, Risk assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) scientific payload will function as an environmental station for the two to four days of the surface mission.\nTo achieve this, teams of scientists and engineers from nine countries around the world will develop a dedicated suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction (MetWind), humidity (MetHumi), pressure (MetBaro) and surface temperature (MarsTem), and to determine the transparency of the atmosphere (ODS).\nDREAMS will also make the first measurements of electrical fields at the planet’s surface with its MicroARES detector. Electrical fields are likely to be generated when grains rub against each other in the dust-rich atmosphere, so landing during the dust storm season increases the chance of being able to study this charging and its consequences.\nIn addition to the surface payload, a colour camera system on the EDM will deliver valuable additional scientific data, as well as spectacular images. No design has yet been chosen for the camera, but a decision is expected before the end of this year.\nThe story was originally published by ESA here.",

    "You have been assigned a task to implement a logging system for a large software project. The logging system should log various events and actions that occur within the software. However, you notice that there is a potential issue with the current implementation.\n\nThe code snippet provided uses a logging function to write log messages to a file. However, it is missing the necessary checks and error handling to ensure that the file is opened and closed properly.\n\nYour task is to modify the code snippet to add the necessary checks and error handling. Specifically, you need to:\n\n1. Add code to check if the file exists before attempting to open it for writing. If the file does not exist, display an error message: \"File not found.\" Additionally, if the file exists, but the current user does not have the necessary permissions to write to the file, display an error message: \"Insufficient permissions to write to the file.\"\n\n2. Add code to handle the case where the file fails to open properly. In addition to displaying an error message: \"Failed to open the file,\" prompt the user to enter a new file name or provide an option to create a new file.\n\n3. Add code to ensure that the file is closed properly after writing the log message. If the file fails to close, display an error message: \"Failed to close the file.\" Additionally, implement a mechanism to automatically reopen the file and continue logging if the file is closed unexpectedly.\n\nModify the code snippet to fix these issues and make the logging system more robust.",
